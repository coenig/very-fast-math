-- Road Topology (terminology and basic properties):
-- * Section: straight road part, e.g., a highway chunk with length |SD|, where:
--    * S is a "source" point in 2D space denoting the entry to the section, and
--    * D is a "drain" point in 2D space denoting the exit of the section.
--    * A is the angle of the section relative to the horizontal axis.
--    * n is the maximum number of lanes the section may have on each of its "segments" (see below).
--   Originally, the EnvModel contained only 1 section with S=(0, 0), and A = 0.
-- * Segment: longitudinal part of a section (given by its begin and lasting to the begin of the next segment or the end of the section), with individual properties assigned to it, particularly number of lanes <= n. A section fully consists of segments, the first starts at the source, the last ends in the drain, all segment lengths sum up to |SD|.
--   Note that in the nuXmv implementation, a section is given by S and A, while D is derived from these two and the sum of the segments' lengths.
-- * Connection: a tuple (j, k) of sections (given by their IDs) with:
--    * k is an "outgoing connection" of j, and
--    * j is an "incoming connection" of k.
--   When a car drives beyond the drain of a section, it is associated (non-det-ically.) to one of the outgoing connections of the section, and placed on the drivable space (conjunction; see below) between those.
-- * Road Graph: a collection of sections with a set of arbitrary many outgoing connections associated to each section.
-- * Conjunction: The drivable space from the drain of one section to the source of a connected section. [TODO: might have been referred to as "junction" earlier.]
-- * Seclet: collective term for a section OR a conjunction. At any time, each car is associated to a seclet, resp. referred to as the car:
--    * being "on section i", or
--    * traversing "from section j to section k".
-- * Junction/crossing: the area built up by several overlapping conjunctions that create a common drivable space.
